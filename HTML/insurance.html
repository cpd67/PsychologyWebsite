        <li>Is there insurance coverage for mental health treatment?</li>
          <p>Health insurance plans should also provide mental health coverage. Before your visit, it is important to know whether a therapist is in your health insurance network. Often the mental health agency will be able to provide you with your co-pay information prior to your appointment. You may also wish to check your health insurance website for providers who are in network for you. If you have an out-of-pocket deductible, the deductible will need to be met before the insurance begins to pay for sessions. Co-pays for counseling sessions are often $15-40 dollars per session. Most college counseling centers provide this service as part of the tuition paid as a student, and additional fees are not required or are very nominal.</p>
        <li>Do health insurance companies typically cover the cost of prescriptions for mental illnesses?</li>
          <p>Yes, insurance companies should cover the cost of prescriptions for mental illnesses to the same extent that they cover other types of illnesses.  There may be a cop-pay for your medication.</p>
        <li>What if I can’t pay for therapy or medication?</li>
          <p>Many mental health agencies have client assistance funds, and most community mental health agencies have sliding scale fees based upon income. There are many programs that offer a reduced cost for medications. You can check on prescriptions that are covered under Target or Wal-Mart’s $4/month or $10/3 month program and ask your prescriber to prescribe one of the meds on that list. You also can check <a href="www.needymeds.com">this website</a> --you may be able to get your prescription at a reduced cost or even free.</p>

        <li>Iâ€™m struggling to understand my sexual identity. Is this normal?</li>
          <p>Struggling to understand your sexuality is absolutely normal. Growth and development occur in every facet of your life: in physical body changes, spirituality, career interests, your sense of self, etc., so it is only natural that growth and development occur in the area of sexuality as well. As you mature, you learn to understand all parts of yourself, including who you are as a sexual being.</p>
        <li>Is being homosexual classified as a mental illness?</li>
          <p>No. In previous diagnostic manuals, clinicians considered homosexuality a mental illness due to the belief that it was an atypical form of sexuality. In more recent decades, this belief has been disproved through research and data collection about human sexuality.</p>
        <li>What is the definition of sexual assault?</li>
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice defines sexual assault as any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient. Forced sexual intercourse, sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape all fall under the category of sexual assault.</p>
        <li>In the past, I was sexually abused. How do I cope?</li>
          <p>It is most beneficial to pursue treatment through a support group or individual therapy with a professional specializing in trauma or sexual abuse. Past trauma has a way of causing difficulty in our present lives, so it is important to seek treatment.
    Recounting every detail of the abuse is not the goal of therapy. The goal of therapy is to gain a sense of control over your life as you acknowledge the trauma, and find ways to prevent the trauma from influencing your present. Therapy will help you live a healthy and functional life in spite of the abuse.</p>

        <li>What is depression?</li>
          <p>According to the Mayo Clinic, depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Depression affects how you feel, think, and behave, and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble completing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living. Depression is more than a bout of the blues, it isn’t a weakness, and you can’t simply “snap out of it.”  Depression may require long-term treatment--but don't get discouraged. Most people with depression feel better with medication, psychological counseling, or both.

        <li>What are some signs, symptoms, and treatments for depression?</li>
          <p>Most people associate depression with intense sadness and crying, melancholy, or feeling “blue.” While pervasively sad feelings are very common in depression, some people show symptoms such as being easily frustrated and irritable. In almost all cases, the individual has difficulty enjoying activities he or she once found pleasurable. Some individuals may seem to move as if they are in slow motion, while others experience agitation and are unable to relax. Other common signs or symptoms of depression are sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep or sleeping excessively), appetite disturbance (often with significant weight loss or gain), fatigue, feelings of helplessness or hopelessness, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and difficulty concentrating. An individual may have frequent thoughts of death in general or more specific thoughts or plans for suicide.
Studies have shown that the most effective treatments for depression are a combination of therapy, especially cognitive behavioral therapies, and medication.  Healthy lifestyle changes, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, participating in enjoyable activities and seeking out relationships with others also help combat depression.</p>
        <li>What is the difference between being sad and being clinically depressed?</li>
          <p>Sadness is a normal human emotion, but sometimes it is difficult for people to determine if they are experiencing sadness or depression. First, you must keep in mind that clinical depression exists outside of reasonable sadness related to grief, loss, or life change. If sadness continues for an extended period of time or you are experiencing sadness for at least half of the time each week, it might be worth evaluating if you have other symptoms of depression. Sadness is just one symptom of clinical depression.  Typically, individuals with clinical depression experience numerous symptoms such as irritability, changes in sleep, loss of interest, inattention, indecisiveness, pessimism, changes in appetite, agitation, hopelessness, and/or feelings of guilt.</p>
        <li>What usually causes depression?</li>
          <p>There are many different factors that play into the development of depression.  For example, a few risk factors for depression include family history, life experiences, and even an individual’s environment. Certain people are genetically predisposed to anxiety and depression. However, it is important to note that not everyone who carries these genes will develop depression. Experiencing emotional, heartbreaking or very stressful events may also play a role. Losing a loved one, financial troubles, and social exclusion are just a few examples of big events that may trigger depression.</p>
        <li>How long does depression usually last?</li>
          <p>Some individuals experience depression for only a few months and need minimal treatment. About 40% of those with depression begin to experience relief within three months of onset, and about 80% begin recovery within one year. For those who have more difficult recoveries, there may be co-existing conditions such as anxiety, bipolar disorder or a psychotic disorder. When someone has had two or more months with no symptoms, he or she is considered to be in remission from their depression.</p>
        <li>Are there different levels of depression?</li>
          <p>Clinicians attempt to “measure” levels of depression with labels of mild, moderate or severe. These classifications are based upon the number and severity of symptoms a person exhibits. Another important consideration is the impact of the person’s depression on his/her overall functioning. For example, someone who is unable to get out of bed is more likely experiencing a deeper level of depression than someone who oversleeps, but is able to make it to school or work.</p>
        <li>What do I do and where do I go if I believe I may have depression?</li>
          <p>If you believe you may have depression, there are several ways you can seek out support. Most people contact a primary care physician or speak to a school counselor. Both would provide good information about services in your area and keep your inquiry confidential.</p>
        <li>How does depression differ between males and females?</li>
          <p>Many studies have examined the ways in which depression differs between male and females. While the symptoms of depression are often the same, the experience of depression between the genders often differs.  Research has shown that due to the biological makeup of females and their hormone and gene development prior to birth, females are about twice as likely to develop depression.</p>
        <li>Is seasonal depression real?</li>
          <p>Seasonal depression is real. Individuals with this condition often develop a pattern of recurring depression in the winter months and remission in the spring/summer. However, there are some who experience onset and remission of symptoms other times of the year.  In addition to typical mood symptoms, overeating, craving carbohydrates, and weight gain are often features in this form of depression.</p>
        <li>I have heard the term “manic depression”, what is that?</li>
          <p>Manic depressive illness, otherwise known as Bipolar disorder is a mental health disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood.  There may be periods of time where an individual might exhibit similar symptoms to those described as “depression”. There are other times, however, where a person might feel that their mood is heightened or  “manic”. Symptoms of mania often include elevated energy level and positive mood. Episodes are often accompanied by changes in mood, energy level, sleep, appetite, ability to function. More information on Bipolar disorder can be found on the National Institute for Mental Health <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/bipolar-disorder/index.shtml">website</a>.</p>
        <li>What is psychosis?</li>
          <p>Psychosis has been identified as an episode where a person seems to have  “break from reality”. This may be an indicator that the person is struggling with a more serious mental illness.

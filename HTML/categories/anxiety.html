        <li>What are the best ways to manage stress?</li>
          <p>We all respond to stress differently--things that cause stress for one person may not cause stress for another. Therefore, there is no absolute answer in terms of what might be the best way for everyone to manage their stress. What is true for everyone, however, is that we have more control over managing our stress than we often think. No matter how out of control we feel things are, we still have control over our thoughts, emotions, and the ways we deal with stress. Stress management can help us find healthier ways to deal with stress, take charge of our thoughts and emotions, and reduce the harmful effects stress has on our lives.
             The American Psychological Association has developed a <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2007/10/stress-tips.aspx">"Stress Tip Sheet”</a> that may be helpful in terms of finding the best ways to manage stress.</p>
        <li>When does stress become anxiety?</li>
          <p>Stress and anxiety are very closely related to each other and often significantly impact one another. Long term stress is one of the key contributing factors in the development of numerous mental health disorders. It is also possible that a person may have anxiety in a particular area, and additional stress occurs due to their symptoms of anxiety. For example, a student with anxiety may struggle going to class because a classroom setting causes them a great deal of anxiety. Missing class causes the student additional stress because they do not get the information they need for a test, leading the student to fail the test, resulting in an increase in their overall stress.</p>
        <li>What is the difference between worrying and an anxiety disorder?</li>
          <p>Worry is present in everyone’s lives, whether it be worry about family, the future, health, school, performance, jobs, finances, religion, etc. When your worry becomes so frequent that it happens more than half of your day and is inhibiting your normal daily activities, it may be worth evaluating if you have other symptoms of an anxiety disorder. Worry is just one symptom of an anxiety disorder. Most individuals with anxiety disorders experience a variety of symptoms which may include some of the following: ruminating or intrusive thoughts, nail biting, skin picking, increased muscle tension/soreness, difficulty concentrating, changes in energy, reassurance seeking, social isolation, difficulty sleeping, urge to repeat behaviors, and/or changes in desire to attend school/work.
If someone were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, what would be the best form of treatment for the individual?
Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) has been quite effective for many people struggling with an anxiety disorder. CBT helps them to identify, understand, and modify thinking and behavior patterns that may have led them to their current situation. CBT also helps people learn how to control their anxiety. Sometimes medication is an effective and important additional component of treatment for anxiety but should not be the only treatment used.  Many people also try mindful meditation and relaxation exercises.</p>
